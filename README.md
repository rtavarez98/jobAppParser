# Job Application Parser

This project was created in order to easily keep track of multiple job applications and their status through a mongoDB.
It uses the MERN tech stack and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run

In order to run this program:

**1)** Start two terminal instances and navigate to the 'server' and 'src' folders respectively

**2)** Run the command `node app.js` in the 'server' folder to run the backend

**3)** Run the command `npm start` in the 'src' folder to run the frontend

**4)** The program should automatically open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default browser

## Features to be Added Later
- Page should reload after creating, deleting or editing a job application
- Include Puppeteer to automatically parse through a job posting
- Style the page with CSS to be easily readable and visually appealing
- Add a license
